# TaskManagementSystem  

A simple CRUD-based Task Management System designed to manage tasks with categories, deadlines, and statuses. The project aims to provide a user-friendly way to organize tasks efficiently, using modern technologies for both backend and frontend development.  

## Development Process ðŸ›   

This project was planned and developed following Agile principles using the Scrum framework. The planning and task management were organized using *Trello*, with tasks categorized into:  
- *Backlog*: Features and ideas to be implemented.  
- *In Progress*: Tasks currently under development.  
- *Done*: Completed tasks.  

### Why Trello?  
Using Trello helped in:  
1. *Visualizing progress*: A clear Kanban board provided real-time updates on the status of each task.  
2. *Prioritization*: Ensured that high-value features were implemented first.  
3. *Collaboration*: Facilitated teamwork and task delegation (if working with a team).  

To demonstrate, here's a snapshot of the Trello board used for this project:

## Features  
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks.  
- Categorize tasks for better organization.  
- Track task deadlines and statuses (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).  
- REST API backend for seamless data interaction.  
- Responsive and interactive frontend for an enhanced user experience.  

## Tech Stack  
### Backend  
- *Spring Boot*: Provides the REST API.  
- *JPA/Hibernate*: For Object Relational Mapping (ORM).  
- *Swagger*: For API documentation.  

### Frontend  
- *React*: A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  

### Database  
- *PostgreSQL*: A powerful, open-source relational database system.  

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
- *Java 17 or higher*  
- *Node.js & npm*  
- *PostgreSQL*  
- *Maven*
